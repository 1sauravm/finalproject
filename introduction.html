            <h2>What is Deep Fake AI?</h2>
            <p>Deepfake technology enables the creation of highly realistic videos and audio by swapping one person's appearance with another's. This technology excels in producing or modifying content that can deceive viewers. Deepfakes combine "deep learning" from AI with the concept of fakery. Chosen by our team for its profound societal impact and diverse applications, deepfake technology has a dual nature. While infamous for creating counterfeit content, it also offers beneficial uses such as giving voice to the voiceless, lowering film production costs, and forging connections through digital embodiments of the departed. The significance of deepfakes lies in their intertwining of technological advancement and ethical dilemmas, challenging the veracity of media content and trust. Their influence extends beyond entertainment, potentially transforming sectors like e-commerce, advertising, and education. As deepfakes evolve, distinguishing real from fake grows more difficult, emphasizing the need for effective detection and verification methods.</p>

            <h2>History behind Deep Fake AI</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1997: Creation of the Video Rewrite program by Christoph Bregler and others. This was the first application able to alter existing videos of a person speaking by overlaying new audio, enabling accurate lip sync. It used machine learning techniques and was initially used for movie dubbing.</li>
                <li>2001: Development of the Active Appearance Model (AAM) by Timothy F. and others. AAM is a computer vision algorithm that enhanced the efficiency of face matching and tracking.</li>
                <li>2014: Introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) by Ian Goodfellow. GANs are a significant component in creating realistic manipulated videos, involving two AI agents: a generator that forges images and a discriminator that detects fakes. The generator improves until it can create images indistinguishable from real ones.</li>
                <li>2017: Coining of the term “Deepfake” by a Reddit user named "deepfake." This user shared manipulated videos using open-source face-swap technology, created with consumer-grade computers and publicly available software. The term "deepfake" eventually referred to the videos themselves.</li>
