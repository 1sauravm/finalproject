                <p> <h3>  Deepfake AI has profound social implications: </h3>

Political and Social Concerns: Deepfakes can be used to impersonate political leaders or create false narratives, potentially destabilizing governments and causing social unrest.
Innate Harms: Misuse of deepfake technology can lead to defamation, blackmail, and misinformation, eroding trust in media and institutions. The main political concern is the 
        use of deepfakes to create convincing false narratives that can influence elections, incite violence, and cause international conflicts. Deepfakes can be used to 
        discredit individuals, invade privacy, and facilitate blackmail and fraud, leading to societal distrust. From this view, deepfakes could be seen as harmful due
        to their potential to cause widespread distress. This lens would focus on the rights violations and deception inherent in deepfake creation, regardless of 
        the consequences. This approach would question the character and intentions of the creators of deepfakes, promoting the need for integrity and trustworthiness 
        in digital content. <div class="image-section">

<h3> Ethical Lenses:</h3>

Utilitarian Perspective: Deepfake AI can be viewed positively if it enhances entertainment and creative expression but negatively if it results in widespread misinformation and harm to individuals and society.
Deontological Perspective: From a duty-based standpoint, creating deepfakes that violate consent and privacy is unethical, irrespective of potential benefits. </p>
