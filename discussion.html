      <h3>  Deepfake AI has profound social implications: </h3>

Political and Social Concerns: Deepfakes can be used to impersonate political leaders or create false narratives, potentially destabilizing governments and causing social unrest.
Innate Harms: Misuse of deepfake technology can lead to defamation, blackmail, and misinformation, eroding trust in media and institutions.
<h3> Ethical Lenses:</h3>

Utilitarian Perspective: Deepfake AI can be viewed positively if it enhances entertainment and creative expression but negatively if it results in widespread misinformation and harm to individuals and society.
Deontological Perspective: From a duty-based standpoint, creating deepfakes that violate consent and privacy is unethical, irrespective of potential benefits.
